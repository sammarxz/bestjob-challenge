# BestJob Front-end Challenge
A new day. A new challenge. Here I took the challenge to try the job as a front-end developer for BestJob. The challenge was cool to be done. A classic game with a nerdy twist: "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" taken from the TV series: The Big Bang Theory. 

I wanted to make the game logic as separate as possible from the interface components, so I used ContextAPI with a hook. While the interface, I wanted to make it simple and functional, using emojis and tailwindcss to help me.
